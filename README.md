Just some of my ideas

1) Political Comic (Policomical? Comitical? PoliCom?...) 2/24/16

An app to sends/shows the user a (relevant?) political comic 
  - comes with article relevant to comic
  - refreshes at a specified time interval
  
2) Phone Hanger-Upper (Sleep Talker? Sleepy Phone?...) Sometime before 2/24/16, ask MQ

An app that hangs up the phone for you in case you fall asleep during a call
  - hangs up the call after specified time value (based on call time)
  - thats basically it lol
